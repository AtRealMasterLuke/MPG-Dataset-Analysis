# MPG-Dataset-Analysis
This project involves the analysis of the MPG (Miles Per Gallon) dataset using Python. The dataset is loaded from Seaborn and includes various features related to car specifications, which are used to predict the MPG.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing to understand the characteristics of the dataset and prepare it for further analysis and modeling.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda (recommended for managing packages and environments)
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
## Project Structure
- mpg_analysis.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
## Future Work
- Further EDA and visualization
- Data modeling and prediction
- Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation
## Contributing
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you have any improvements or suggestions for the project.
